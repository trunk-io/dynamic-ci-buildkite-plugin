 * child would block the event loop this server answers on — which is a hang
 * rather than a failure, and costs a test run to diagnose.
 *
 * The plan is parsed against the engine's own response schema before it is
 * served, so these tests cannot pass against a plan shape the engine would never
 * return. That is the response-side half of what `--print-body` does for the
 * request: both directions of the wire contract fail here rather than in a
 * customer's build.
